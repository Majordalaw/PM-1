**Pooja Ranjan**
* Welcome to Ethereum Cat Herders meeting. On our agenda today we have Ethereum network upgrades. We will look into the present and upcoming upgrade will take a look at useful resources. Then it will be followed by other protocol and application development. There's a multiple meeting going on so we can perhaps take a look at the recordings. Then we have events, fellowship and hackathon, new initiative and association, and also the general discussion. Now we can perhaps start with the Dencun upgrade. 

# Dencun [0.40](https://youtu.be/qbrV8CP8Ssc?t=40)
**Pooja Ranjan**
* So as we have mentioned in the earlier meeting, we have launched an app called Learn to Earn and where people can maybe follow the proposals in Dencun, upgrade and be able to collect a Dencun NFT, by answering quizzes to that. Moving on to the next one. And which is the most important thing? Mainly 
* Dencun. Upgrade date has been set for March 13th and it is decided for epoch number 269568. So people should be looking forward to the client's update that we are expecting in a week or so. 
* So, this client update is not only to update your one client, not only the consensus, but also the execution layer client. So if you are on respective discord, that's so good. If not, then please keep your eyes peeled for the, blogs coming up from the Ethereum Foundation 
* Just to update Holesky Fork went live on February 7th. It was quiet. Not too much of noise there, like kind of uneventful event, but it was really good for all the developers team here. People can also refer to Sepolia and Dencun announcement blog post that has been published by Ethereum Foundation blog to learn more about it. And now we have hard fork meta for Dencun upgrade in the last meeting I mentioned that PEEP developers have decided to bring back the meta EIP to share information about the hard fork, the upgrade that we have on Ethereum blockchain.
* So EIP 7569 is the hardfork meta for the Dencun upgrade. People can also find the Dencun interop testing calls and the specs for Cancun and Deneb upgrade, respectively. 

# Next Upgrade [2:58](https://youtu.be/qbrV8CP8Ssc?t=178)
* On execution and consensus layer. We have started a network upgrade thread to discuss the next possible upgrade that is for Prague  and Electra network upgrade. It is at Fellowship of Ethereum magician people can follow that. There's a lot of discussion going on with respect to which EIP should be selected for the upgrade for Electra on the consensus layer and Prague on the execution layer.
* So with the recent, discussion on the selection of EIP, I believe you can find the link here. And very soon it would be added to the hard fork meta, which is for Prague and Electra, and that is EIP number 7600. We have also added playlist for Dencun. And there is a good news for the community that we are also working on discussing. 
* Proposal for the Prague and Electra upgrade. So there's another playlist Prague Electra. 
* I'm not sure. What is the shard name. we perhaps will be able to hear more about it in the upcoming execution layer upgrade, but we have added discussions for the proposals under consideration on execution side as well, as we have recorded an episode with the line and Mike proposal 7251 on the consensus side as well. So please check out the playlist added here in the agenda. Taking a quick pause if people have any question comments here to add. 

# 2. Other Protocol & Application Development [4:33](https://youtu.be/qbrV8CP8Ssc?t=273)
* Very well. Moving on to the other protocol and application development. recently, Vitalik Buterin and Tony shared a blog post on ETH research about increasing the block gas limit. This has been under discussion 
* For quite some time, and the new proposal have, caught attention and developers are trying to find out how to incorporate this in in future upgrades. So if you are interested in research, please, please check out this, blog post by Vitalik 
* There have been multiple protocol calls ongoing. All of them are available at Ethereum protocol YouTube. I have added links to, Roll Call Breakout Room meeting 2.2, that is L2 fees, market and Roll Call meeting 2.3 breakout. That is for Pre-compiled market. 
* Similarly, I have also added the UOF implementers call. Now UOF implementers calls are weekly and yeah, it is planned every Wednesday. We are having this, implementers meeting every week 
* And people can follow the updates. Now we are moving towards testing of it. So if anyone listening to this call may be interesting and interested in helping out with the test script, that would be really nice to have reach out to me or to the UOF team. There is an EVM channel on ETH, R&D discord. You can share your interest with the developers. Similarly on the, workable, proposals, there is an ongoing call for virtual implementers. People are deciding whether to include this on Elektra or not. but yeah 
* These meetings happens bi weekly and, you may follow it on Ethereum protocol YouTube. Recently, there's a new call called Ethereum sequencing and pre confirmation started. we have added link to call zero. 
* This week. And also there was this discussion today earlier today about EBS we know that proposal builder separation was under discussion, but there is a new proposal of minimal EBS. Please be on lookout to learn more about 
* And the changes that it could bring to Beacon Chain. We are hoping to keep on adding information on research and updates, which comes across, the Ethereum ecosystem. So if you have any information, feel free to drop into the, Ethereum Cat Herders, the discord on Education Channel, or just in the general channel. I see a question here in the chat by Santhosh. I am not sure about the answer. The question here is are we planning to capture notes for Ethereum sequencing and pre confirmation calls haven't received any request of getting it documented.
* I might want to take a look if any of the developer is already releasing summary for this. If not, then we can perhaps make an outreach to offer our services to maybe document these notes. Thanks for mentioning that, Santosh. 

# 3. Events, Fellowship, Hackathon [8:19](https://youtu.be/qbrV8CP8Ssc?t=499)
* Moving on to events, fellowship and hackathon EPF Ethereum Protocol Fellowship has recently started a study group. I believe it is, before 
* EPF Study Group protocol fellowship that will be starting, I think, by the end of the March. But, Ethereum Cat herders are planning to collaborate with them and may be able to onboard more fellows. Any developer or any student who may be interested into this Ethereum protocol fellowship may please take a look at the blog post. It's a ten week education series, that they have announced. And yes, if you want to be a part of this, you can also register here. The link is added to the blog post. You can register to the study group and be a part at ETH, R&D discord.
* For the protocol fellowship discussion, there would be a town hall to learn more about it.
* And also these teams are joining at Denver. So if you have any questions around this, feel free to reach out to, the team or let me know. I will be happy to make an introduction. 
* Moving on Ethereum Foundation has recently announced academic grant, that is for a wish list. Share by client team. People interested on doing a research or maybe building a project based on the wish list. Please take a look and make your application by the deadline. 
* We all know that ETH Denver is around. it is starting from February 23rd. the hackathon wiki will start from February 23rd, and, it will continue till March 3rd, 2024. We are happy to announce that the application for Ethereum cat herders, speaking opportunity have been accepted and I will be speaking on the EIP process.
* Also, Fellowship of Ethereum magician team has organized an EIP day, so I'll be there as well, representing cat herders and maybe talking to new and existing authors to understand how they find the present process of documentation, or if they have any suggestion for further improvement.
* In addition to that, I'm also working with Ethereum Foundation, to onboard more women in protocol development. 
* So, the group name is Women and Ethereum protocol. And, we will be sharing the invite link shortly. we are on on the process of getting everything sorted. this venue is not exactly the ETH Denver venue, but it is on March 29th. Sorry, February 29th. 
* So it is in the week of ETH Denver. And if you are around, it's going to be in the Edge City. Please feel free to drop by and we would love to have you share this information with more female participants, more female, developers who are interested into the development of protocol Ethereum protocol client level development. I'm also working with, the ERC draft team, to maybe have this, ERC at Denver organized. Will be looking forward to get more information from ERC editor Victor. 
* Yeah. that's mostly about the ETH Denver and the events that we have over there. And we can perhaps have a, Women's Day celebration in association with Ethereum Foundation to maybe talk, with female developers and see, how they can, perhaps encourage more female participants to be a part of the Etherum ecosystem. I've also added the link to the Eth Berlin, which is coming up on May 24th to 26th and if I remember correctly, Edcon is also announced. So please take a look at the Edcon website to get to know more about the event in 2024. 

# 4. New initiative/association/team discussion [13:07](https://youtu.be/qbrV8CP8Ssc?t=787)
* Moving on to new initiative, association and team discussion. I think we have released the blog post as well as the podcast for, Meet the Hurdles. And I don't see, Zeke on the call and I do not have further update about the ecosystem project demo. I understand there was some issue with uploading. I may have to take a look into you know, giving permission to YouTube to have a direct upload, but we'll keep everyone posted here. 

# 5. General updates/discussion [13:45](https://youtu.be/qbrV8CP8Ssc?t=825)
* Moving on to the next section, which is general update and discussion. The first item listed here is 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* ERC 4044 recently, I have been approached by a few EIP and ERC authors, to understand the status of ERC 404. There has been a lot of engagement on Twitter, claiming ERC 404 is a standard, is a token standard. Just to be clear about it and avoid any kind of confusion, ERC 404 is not an Ethereum standard that is not a part of Ethereum repository. However, people are free to name their standard as whatever they want, but this particular proposal or the group has hasn't reached Ethereum process.
* They have not gone with the process of a standardization, and this number has not been allocated to the ERC as they are claiming.
* So if you come across that this is a token standard, this is an airdrop or something like that, please be aware of that. ERC 404 is not an Ethereum standard. 
* The next section is new website domain. we mentioned in the last meeting that we have acquired the domain.com, and we are also in process of, getting the Ethcatheder website updated with a new tech stack. And yeah, as I see Nandhan on the call, he perhaps have made some progress. And then if you would like to maybe provide some updates on where we are with the V3 version of website

**Nandan**
* Yes. so, coming to the V3 version, like, v3 of this website, main aim over here, is to have an admin panel to control all aspects of the website. so anyone of you can update content on the website, to keep everything up to date as and when something happens, you can update the website. So this can like our website can provide latest information to everyone at any point of time. it's almost ready except a few pages. so I hope it will go live, in a week or two more. Max. should I share a demo of the website or something? 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* That would be nice.  

**Nandan**
* Yeah, I'll share my screen. Yeah. I hope you all can see my screen. Yeah. So, we won't be able to, like, see, major difference in UI. It's going to remain the same. UI is going to remain the same. But, major change is going to happen on the backend side. So this is the admin panel. User can sign in. but if the user is not an admin, he or she won't be able to access the admin panel and, assigning the role of admin or an owner is, only like the feature is only available to the owner of, like members assigned the role of owner so only owners can change roles of other users.
* So if the user is an admin, he or she can access this admin panel where, a whole network upgrade page can be created from scratch without a single line of code. You just have to enter the upgrade name. For now I have the Tennekoon one, so I'll just select this. Yeah. So you can add new considered proposals. You can add new resources. You can add new updates videos right from here 
* You add something over here it will get reflected on the website in real time. So that is the main focus of this, V3 and you can add blocks and events as well, YouTube videos, surveys, if any, you can mark them completed or incomplete. You can do that. And another thing would be community feedback. So anyone who visits our website can just come here, drop a feedback. it won't be published on the website right away, but, it will be shown in the admin panel 
* All the admins can see all the, feedbacks over here. It will be unpublished by default. you can come take a preview of the, feedback if you think it's fine. to go on the website, you can just publish it using these buttons or you can delete it if you think it's vulgar or, it does not, make any sense. and coming to team members, all like the owner can add any number of team members and change their status to active or emeritus. and that will be reflected as well in real time. So this is the progress on V3.
* There are some, like few pages left, like, Meet The Herders and a couple more, which I'll aim to finish within a week or two more. That's it from my side. Thank you. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Thank you. Nandan. Talking about Meet The Herders, I think I skipped the update. Harish. do you have any further updates on that side? Like, are we planning to have, any recording in upcoming month? 

**Harish**
* I think in a month it should be possible. Right now, my main issue 

**Harish**
* Is all, all possible interviewees are in Eastern Time zone, and I can't seem to schedule it, late night, but I'm trying to schedule something with George. Hopefully I can catch him towards early March. So within a month, I hope I can at least get one out. yeah, that that's my update on that. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Sounds good. Yeah. I mean, we can even target to have, one member a month. That is not bad. Very well, moving on to next updates. I have added link to new GitHub. People may notice a change in the address. 
* Yeah, moving on to ECH engineering. I don't see George on the call, but I am aware that Verkal proposal has been added. And also the GitHub link has been updated so we can perhaps mark these tasks as closed. And we also have a page for Dencun in version two right now, but we do not have it for Prague and Electra, which we hope to get it released in next two weeks or so. Whenever we are live with the version v3, people can also find information about Ethereum testnet on the testnet page at Ethereum Cat herders.com. We might want to work on Meet the herders.
* Okay. Yeah, that was mentioned earlier. And then that it would be, covered in V3 version. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* The next one is learn to Earn Dencun Nandan page. I'm not sure if he has some inputs with respect to the NFT, how people are doing and if we can, yeah. If we have any question with respect to the Learn to Earn app, may be able to answer 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* That. Nandan, please feel free to share, how people can take this quiz. And, where we are with respect to participation, do we need to maybe promote it more or Yeah. How do you feel about it? 

**Nandan**
* Yeah. so coming to L2Eit's just, like, you just have to log in with, some wallet that you have, and then you can watch videos and then attempt the quiz. Currently coming to the engagement. I'm not sure. Like, I don't have the exact number, but I think I think it needs some promotion. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Very well, we can perhaps take a look into it. Just may make sure that quizzes are are easier for them to answer and definitely take a look into it. We would encourage people to maybe take a look at the app. If you have any question or feedback, please share it with us on Ethereum Cat herder's Discord and we'll be happy to help you out. And this is a very good opportunity to collect NFT for another upgrade of Ethereum. So give it a try and let us know if you have any difficulty accessing it or minting NFT. 
* Moving on to the operations section, we have released two shots recently recorded with, lion and Mike on, proposal 7251. They are highly encouraging. They mention that, Ethereum ecosystem may look intimidating from outside but when you actually join any discord and want to contribute, you may find that people are so helpful and you have a lot of opportunities to make your introduction and contribute to the ecosystem. So if you are someone who who are looking forward to become an Ethereum developer one day, please join ETH, R&D, Discord or Ethereum categories.
* Discord will be happy to help you out to, introduce you to different clients where you can perhaps make your contribution. 
* On EIP Insights I see the insight.com has been updated. Here we can see table for EIP, ERC and ERC and ripple together. I see three proposals in last call on EIP section my understanding is these are the proposals for the synchronous grid and this will be moved to final once they are deployed on the main net. And yeah, I see the RFP proposal hasn't been updated. I want to know is it something that we can perhaps take a look and get it fixed before the next meeting? 

**Nandan**
* Yeah. I will look into it. I'll fix that as well. 

**Pooja Ranjan**
* Thank you. Yeah, that's all about it. Taking a look here, it looks like we have received seven new drafts, including EIP and ERC. But there is one more for RIP, so we can consider it as eight new proposals. There are five proposals in review status, three in last call, two in final status, and one proposal was withdrawn. I see a bunch of open proposals for moving to stagnant status. Will be getting further updates in upcoming weeks. On Peep and EIP, and we would be scheduling more meetings to maybe follow the Dencun and discussion around the Electra upgrade.
* So, please take a look at the GitHub link added here where you can also join the planned meeting. 
* On Ech funding side, I think we haven't claimed for octant Epoch two yet. I will have to take a look into the process. And yeah, I'm hoping to have a meeting with the governance team and will follow the process to claim the funding received here. 
* On meeting notes section, I see the notes for All core dev 180 has been added. EIP 99 have been added, but would have consensus 126 is missing. We may want to follow with scheduled notes documenting person and see if we can share the notes sooner rather than later. One important thing that I want to mention here with respect to notes documenting, please add or update the Readme file.
* It's very important to have your notes accessible if updated on the Readme as it is very difficult to find the notes and it's complete waste of our effort documenting and make it not accessible.
* So please take out additional few minutes to update the Readme file. 
* With this we are towards the end of the meeting. I wonder if anyone had any comment, question or any updates to add for the. Very well. well thank you everyone for joining us today. I hope to see you all
